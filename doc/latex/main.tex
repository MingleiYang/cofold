The core of the Vienna RNA Package is formed by a collection of routines for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures. These routines can be accessed through stand-\/alone programs, such as RNAfold, RNAdistance etc., which should be sufficient for most users. For those who wish to develop their own programs we provide a library which can be linked to your own code.

This document describes the library and will be primarily useful to programmers. However, it also contains details about the implementation that may be of interest to advanced users. The stand-\/alone programs are described in separate man pages. The latest version of the package including source code and html versions of the documentation can be found at \par
